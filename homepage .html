  </header>

  <div class="container">
    <p>Hello there!</p>
    <p>I'm Shivansh Krishna, a 19-year-old boy with a passion for front-end development. I am enthusiastic about creating
      visually appealing and interactive websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My journey into the world of web
      development began when I was in high school, and since then, I've been continuously exploring and honing my skills in
      this exciting field.</p>

    <p>HTML and CSS are the building blocks of the web, and I find joy in crafting well-structured HTML documents and
      styling them with beautiful CSS designs. I am also familiar with JavaScript, which allows me to add dynamic elements
      and interactivity to my web projects.</p>

    <p>Throughout my learning journey, I have worked on various projects, experimenting with different techniques and
      staying up-to-date with the latest trends in front-end development. My dedication to continuous improvement drives me
      to learn new tools and technologies to enhance my skills further.</p>

    <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new web designs for inspiration, participating in coding challenges,
      or enjoying a cup of coffee while sketching out new website ideas. I believe that a well-designed website not only
      provides an excellent user experience but also leaves a lasting impression on visitors.</p>

    <p>I am eager to contribute my knowledge and skills to real-world projects and collaborate with like-minded developers
      to build exciting web experiences that make a positive impact on people's lives.</p>

    <p>If you share a similar passion for front-end development or want to discuss a potential collaboration, feel free to
      reach out to me. I'm always excited to connect with fellow developers and share ideas.</p>
